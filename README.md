# MKS65_Final_Project
The main premise of the project is to create music program that can play music and take inputs from clients as well as send relevant data.
## Features
  * Music player- The program will be able to use a driectory of songs and play it through execvp certain command line commands
  * Requests- The program will set a connection between multiple clients and takes requests of songs. We can use smemaphones to create a music queue.
      - Additionally we can maybe download unavailble songs (not sure though)
  * Quiz- Using the network system the clients can also participate in a quiz game where they guess the name of the song. The server will take inputs and see who got the answer first. Hints will also be sent to the clients to help them out
  * Organizer- We can take inspiration from teh music library and make the program organize the songs based on Genre/Title/Author

## Division (We don't know who will do what yet)
  1. Networking
  2. Music Player using the command line 
  3. Quiz and Organizer 
  4. Requests and setting up the queues
